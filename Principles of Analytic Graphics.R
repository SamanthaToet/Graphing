#### Principles of Analytic Graphics ####

# 1.) Show comparisons
#   - Evidence for a hypothesis is always relative to another competing one
#   - Use controls

# 2.) Show causality, MECHANISM, explanation, systematic structure
#   - What is your causal framework for thinking about a question?
#   - Always ask "compared to what?"

# 3.) Show multivariate data
#   - Show as much data on one plot as you can
#   - Correlation != Causation
#   - Simpson's Paradox: a  trend that appears in different groups of data
#       disappears when these groups are combined

# 4.) Integration of evidence (words, numbers, diagrams, images, tables, etc.)
#   - Use as many modes of displaying evidence as you can
#   - Don't let the tool drive the analysis

# 5.) Describe and document the evidence with appropriate labels, scales, 
#       sources, source code, etc. 

# 6.) Content is king: quality, relevance, integrity
